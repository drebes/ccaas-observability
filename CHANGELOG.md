## Release 2026-05

**✨ New Features & Modules**
*   **CCaaS Telemetry Milestone Logger:** Added an automated GCS ingestion pipeline (Terraform module, Eventarc trigger, and Cloud Run service) to transform raw session metadata uploads into structured telemetry milestones. This brings call/chat interaction metrics that were previously locked in metadata files directly into Google Cloud Observability (Cloud Logging and Monitoring).
    *   **Consistently Matched Schemas:** The generated logs conform to a strict, well-defined schema (published under `metadata_logging/schema` and `docs`) where fields are consistently mapped to the same path, simplifying log-based metrics extraction.
    *   **Regression Testing & Paths Routing:** Includes a zero-dependency local regression test suite (`test_milestones.py`) using PII-redacted fixtures, and supports dynamic path-to-resource routing (`path_configs`) to handle multi-tenant setups.
    *   **Dashboards & Metrics:** Standardized log-based metrics and dashboards built on top of these milestone logs will be delivered in an upcoming release based on customer feedback.

**🙏 A shoutout to**
*   Our partners who generously provided sample CCaaS session metadata payloads to help us validate, generalize, and refine the milestone schemas!

## Release 2026-04

**✨ New Features & Modules**
*   **CCaaS Log Analytics Dashboard (`modules/analytics_dashboard`):** Added a new dashboard with 6 tables using Log Analytics (SQL) to trace interactions across CCaaS and Dialogflow.
    *   Widget 1: Interaction Aggregate Events Timeline.
    *   Widget 2: Interaction Mapping Table.
    *   Widget 3-6: Raw logs for CCaaS Activity, Events, DF Audit, and Runtime.
    *   Fully supports UI time-range selector by removing hardcoded time filters.

**🛠 Directory Restructuring**
*   Renamed `call_analysis` directory to `interaction_tracing` to be channel-neutral (supporting both calls and chats).
*   Created BigQuery versions of the SQL scripts in `interaction_tracing/bq/`.

**🐛 Bug Fixes & Improvements**
*   Fixed prefix bug in SQL scripts (`ccaip_events.sql`, etc.) where `call_` or `chat_` prefixes were duplicated.
*   Refactored `main.tf` in `analytics_dashboard` to use `jsonencode` and Heredoc for SQL queries to fix escaping issues and permanent diffs.

**📈 Metric Enhancements (`modules/calls_dashboard/metrics.tf`)**
*   **Virtual Join Errors v2:** Added `ccaas_call_virtual_join_errors_v2` and `ccaas_chat_virtual_join_errors_v2` metrics to extract `virtual_agent_id` from logs.

**🖥 Dashboard Updates (`modules/errors_dashboard/main.tf`)**
*   **Virtual Join Errors by Agent ID:** Added two new widgets (13 and 14) to display call and chat virtual join errors grouped by `virtual_agent_id`.
*   **Documentation:** Updated the dashboard documentation to include the new charts.

**🙏 A shoutout to**
*   **Bruno and Pranjal:** Thank you for all your support in bringing this toolkit to life!

## Release 2026-03

**✨ New Features & Modules**
*   **CCaaS Errors Dashboard (`modules/errors_dashboard`):** Added a comprehensive, fully managed dashboard dedicated to tracking failures across the platform. It features 13 structured widgets including:
    *   Topline scorecards for Calls Failed, Chats Failed, and Virtual Agent Errors.
    *   Join Error Breakdowns for both Calls and Chats (Total vs. Human vs. Virtual Agent).
    *   Rolling 5m and 60m Failure Ratios for Calls, Chats, and Virtual Agent (Streaming) errors using advanced MQL queries.
    *   A breakdown of Virtual Agent errors grouped by gRPC error type.
    *   A "1d Platform Trend" Prometheus chart tracking global failure ratio drift.
    *   A built-in Markdown widget explaining the entire dashboard layout.

**📈 Metric Enhancements (`modules/calls_dashboard/metrics.tf`)**
*   **`ccaas_streaming_errors_v2`:** Created a new, enriched streaming error metric that extracts `resource_id`, `location`, and `error_type` labels directly from the logs.
*   **`ccaas_va_errors` (Fixed):** Replaced the empty `ccaas_voice_platform_errors` metric with the correct filter (`"error in voice platform"`) and matching label extractors.
*   **Channel-Specific Join Errors:** Added 6 new granular metrics to replace generic join errors. These correctly filter on the `channel` payload field and are mapped to the logging bucket:
    *   `ccaas_call_participant_join_errors` & `ccaas_chat_participant_join_errors`
    *   `ccaas_call_human_join_errors` & `ccaas_chat_human_join_errors`
    *   `ccaas_call_virtual_join_errors` & `ccaas_chat_virtual_join_errors`

**🛠 Dashboard Updates (`modules/calls_dashboard/main.tf`)**
*   **Calls Monitoring:** Migrated the line charts on the primary Calls Dashboard to use the new, labeled `ccaas_streaming_errors_v2` metric.
