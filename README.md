# GECX Monitoring Dashboards

This repository contains a set of Cloud Monitoring dashboards that can be used
to observe the status of Google CCaaS (calls and chats) and Dialogflow (Flow,
Playbooks & Sentiment) metrics.

The dashboards and the underlying logs-based metrics are managed via
[Terraform](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashorp/google/latest).

**Note:** These modules will create new logs-based metrics in the specified
project.

## Prerequisites

*   [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)
    installed.
*   [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) installed.
*   Authenticated to GCP with an account having necessary permissions. Run
    `gcloud auth application-default login`.

## Modules

*   `analytics_dashboard`: Creates a dashboard with log analytics queries to trace
    interactions across CCaaS and Dialogflow.
*   `calls_dashboard`: Creates logs-based metrics and a dashboard to monitor
    metrics related to CCaaS voice calls.
*   `chats_dashboard`: Creates logs-based metrics and a dashboard to monitor
    metrics related to CCaaS chat sessions.
*   `df_dashboard`: Creates logs-based metrics and a dashboard to monitor
    Dialogflow-specific metrics, including Flow execution, Playbook usage, and
    Sentiment Analysis.
*   `metadata_logger`: Sets up the Cloud Run service, Eventarc trigger, GCS permissions, and project IAM roles to ingest and parse session metadata uploads into structured milestone logs. *(Optional, conditionally enabled via `enable_metadata_logger`)*

## Creating the Dashboards and Metrics

1.  **Initialize Terraform:** `terraform init`

2.  **Prepare Variables:** The modules require the following variables to be
    set:

    *   `project_id`: (string) The project ID where the logs exist and to host
        the dashboards and metrics.
    *   `established_call_rate_upper_bound`: (number) The upper bound for the
        "Current Established Call Rate" gauge in the Calls dashboard.
    *   `escalated_chat_rate_upper_bound`: (number) The upper bound for the
        "Current Escalated Chat Rate" gauge in the Chats dashboard.
    *   `enable_metadata_logger`: (boolean, optional) Whether to deploy the metadata logger. Defaults to `false`.
    *   `metadata_logger`: (object) The configuration object for deploying the
        metadata milestone logger. This is only required if `enable_metadata_logger` is set to `true`. This contains:
        *   `storage_project_id`: (string) The GCP project ID hosting the central prober GCS buckets, Eventarc trigger, and Cloud Run service.
        *   `region`: (string) Location for the Cloud Run deployment (e.g. `"europe-west1"`).
        *   `image_url`: (string) The Artifact Registry URI of the compiled container image (e.g. `"europe-docker.pkg.dev/.../metadata-logger:latest"`).
        *   `custom_log_name`: (string, optional) Override log name for extracted milestones in Cloud Logging (defaults to `"<PROJECT_ID>/logs/contactcenteraiplatform.googleapis.com%2Fmetadata"`).
        *   `path_configs`: (map of object) A mapping of source GCS path URIs (e.g., `"gs://bucket/path/"`) to target Contact Center resources (with `ccaas_project_id`, `ccaas_resource_location`, and `ccaas_resource_id`).

    Optional variables:

    *   `log_bucket`: (object) The log bucket to use for the metrics. This
        object has the following attributes:
        *   `location`: (string) The location of the log bucket. Defaults to
            `"global"`.
        *   `name`: (string) The name of the log bucket. Defaults to `"_Default"`.

    The easiest way to pass these variables is via a `project.auto.tfvars` file.
    Create a file named `project.auto.tfvars` in this directory with the
    following content, replacing the placeholder values:

    ```hcl
    project_id                        = "<YOUR_GCP_PROJECT_ID>"
    established_call_rate_upper_bound = 100
    escalated_chat_rate_upper_bound   = 100

    # Set to true to deploy the metadata logger (defaults to false)
    enable_metadata_logger = true

    # Metadata Logger configuration (only required if enable_metadata_logger is true)
    metadata_logger = {
      storage_project_id = "<PROBER_GCP_PROJECT_ID>"
      region             = "europe-west1"
      image_url          = "europe-docker.pkg.dev/<PROBER_GCP_PROJECT_ID>/metadata-logger/metadata-logger:latest"
      path_configs = {
        "gs://ccaip-iva-artifact-9a/iva-prober-gxjs4ra.ew1/metadata/" = {
          ccaas_project_id        = "<TARGET_PROJECT_ID>"
          ccaas_resource_location = "europe-west1"
          ccaas_resource_id       = "iva"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

3.  **Plan and Apply:** `terraform plan` Review the plan to ensure it
    creates the expected logs-based metrics and dashboards.

    ```
    terraform apply
    ```

    Confirm the apply operation when prompted.

## Viewing the Dashboards

Once applied, the dashboards can be found in the Google Cloud Console:

1.  Navigate to the
    [Monitoring > Dashboards](https://console.cloud.google.com/monitoring/dashboards)
    section.
2.  Select the project you specified in the `project_id` variable.
3.  The new dashboards will be listed under the following names:
    *   "Calls Monitoring"
    *   "Chats Monitoring"
    *   "DialogFlow Playbook Monitoring"
    *   "DialogFlow CX Monitoring"
    *   "CCaaS Log Analytics"

## Destroying the Dashboards and Metrics

To remove the dashboards and the logs-based metrics managed by Terraform:

```
terraform destroy
```

## Modifying Dashboards or Metrics

1.  Edit the `*.tf` files within the `modules/` subdirectories to change
    metrics, widgets, or layouts.
2.  Run `terraform plan` to see the proposed changes.
\
3.  Run `terraform apply` to apply the changes.

## Interaction Tracing Scripts

Beyond the Terraform-managed dashboards, this repository also includes a set of Python scripts in the `interaction_tracing/` directory. These scripts are designed to help developers and support engineers fetch, correlate, and visualize logs from Contact Center as a Service (CCaaS) and Dialogflow CX.

**Key features:**

*   Fetch logs from CCaaS and Dialogflow based on interaction IDs (calls or chats).
*   Automatically map CCaaS interaction IDs to Dialogflow Conversation IDs.
*   Generate Mermaid Gantt charts to visualize the timeline of interaction events, making it easier to troubleshoot and understand interaction flows.
*   Analyze logs at scale using standalone BigQuery SQL scripts (see [BQ README](interaction_tracing/bq/README.md)).

For detailed usage and examples, please refer to the `README.md` within the `interaction_tracing/` directory.

**Typical Workflow:**

1.  Use `interaction_tracing/get_all_interaction_logs.py` to gather combined logs for a specific interaction.
2.  Use `interaction_tracing/generate_interaction_timeline.py` to create a visual timeline from the logs.

## Metadata Logging Service

Beyond dashboards, this repository includes the `metadata_logging/` service. It is a Cloud Run-based telemetry ingestion pipeline that extracts structured contact center milestones (such as call creation, queue durations, agent handle events, and transfers) from GCS metadata uploads and logs them as structured entries in Google Cloud Logging.

For detailed usage, local regression testing instructions, build steps, and link directories of all parsed milestones, see the [Metadata Logging Service README](metadata_logging/README.md).

## Permissions


The account used to run Terraform needs sufficient permissions in the target
project, typically including:

*   `logging.metrics.create`
*   `logging.metrics.delete`
*   `logging.metrics.update`
*   `monitoring.dashboards.create`
*   `monitoring.dashboards.delete`
*   `monitoring.dashboards.update`
*   Roles like `logging.admin` and `monitoring.admin` usually suffice.
